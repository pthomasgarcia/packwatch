# Packwatch Phase 2: Scaffolding
# Purpose: Load modules that provide the core application framework, including
# configuration management, state counters, and basic user notifications.
# These are essential building blocks before the main runtime logic.

# Required: globals.sh, systems.sh, loggers.sh, errors.sh (from Phase 0)
#           validators.sh, interfaces.sh, cli.sh (from Phase 1)

# Strict sourcing order:
# 1. configs.sh: Central to loading application configurations.
# 2. counters.sh: Manages application-wide statistics.
# 3. notifiers.sh: Handles desktop notifications.

# Any module sourced by this phase should implement an idempotent guard
# (e.g., PACKWATCH_MODULE_LOADED).
