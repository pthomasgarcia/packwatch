feat: Refactor core logic for modularity and robustness

This commit introduces a major refactoring of the application's core logic to improve modularity, robustness, and maintainability.

Key changes include:

- **Modularization:** The main script has been broken down into smaller, more focused modules with clear responsibilities (e.g., `cli.sh`, `configs.sh`, `updates.sh`). This improves code organization and makes it easier to understand and maintain.

- **Improved Error Handling:** The error handling has been centralized and made more consistent across the application.

- **CLI Enhancements:** The command-line interface has been improved to allow specifying which applications to check.

- **New `script` Installation Type:** A new `script` installation type has been added to support applications that are installed via a shell script (e.g., Ollama).

- **Bug Fixes:**
  - Fixed a bug where UI messages were being captured into variables during the download process, causing installation failures.
  - Corrected the `jq` expression for finding assets in GitHub releases.

- **Code Cleanup:** The codebase has been cleaned up to improve readability and consistency.
