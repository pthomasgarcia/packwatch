refactor(versions): Centralize version extraction logic

This commit introduces a major refactoring of how version strings are extracted and validated, centralizing the logic into the `versions.sh` module to improve robustness and reduce code duplication.

- **New Version Extraction Functions:**
  - Created `versions::extract_from_json` to provide a standardized way to extract and normalize version strings from JSON data.
  - Created `versions::extract_from_regex` to provide a standardized way to extract and normalize version strings from plain text using regular expressions.

- **Improved Validation:**
  - Added a new `validators::check_semver_format` function to provide a basic check for semantic versioning.
  - The configuration validation in `src/core/configs.sh` has been enhanced to validate the format of version-related fields for all application types.

- **Refactored Core Logic:**
  - The `updates.sh`, `repositories.sh`, and `packages.sh` modules have been refactored to use the new centralized version extraction functions. This removes duplicated `grep` and `sed` commands and ensures that version parsing is handled consistently across the application.
