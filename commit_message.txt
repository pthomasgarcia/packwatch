feat: Add script-based installer and refactor Ollama

This commit introduces a new `script` application type to handle installations that are performed by executing a shell script. This provides a more generic and secure way to handle applications like Ollama, removing the need for special-cased logic in the `custom` handler.

Key changes:

- **New `script` type:**
  - Added a new `script` type to `updates.sh` with a corresponding `check_script` handler and `process_script_installation` function.
  - The new type is defined in `config/schema.json` and requires `download_url`, `version_url`, and `version_regex` to be specified.

- **Ollama Refactoring:**
  - The Ollama configuration in `config/conf.d/ollama.json` has been updated to use the new `script` type.
  - The custom checker script `src/core/custom_checkers/ollama.sh` has been deleted as it is no longer needed.

- **Minor Improvements:**
  - The discovery of configuration files in `src/core/configs.sh` is now sorted to ensure a consistent order of execution.
