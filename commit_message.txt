refactor(updates): Centralize installation flow and improve validation

This commit introduces a major refactoring of the update and installation logic to improve modularity, reduce code duplication, and enhance configuration validation.

- **Centralized Installation Flow:**
  - A new generic function, `updates::process_installation`, has been created in `src/core/updates.sh` to handle the common elements of the installation process (e.g., user prompts, dry runs, version updates).
  - The specific installation handlers for `deb`, `appimage`, `script`, and `flatpak` have been refactored to use this new centralized function, significantly reducing code duplication.

- **Enhanced Configuration Validation:**
  - The `configs::validate_single_config_file` function in `src/core/configs.sh` has been improved with more specific and robust validation checks for each application type.

- **Improved Error Handling:**
  - Error hooks have been added to more places in the `updates.sh` and `repositories.sh` modules to provide more detailed and consistent error reporting.

- **Refactored Custom Checkers:**
  - The custom checkers have been updated to pass a JSON string as an argument instead of using namerefs, which improves the robustness of the interface.
