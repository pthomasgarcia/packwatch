refactor(core): Relocate UI printing from loggers to interfaces

This commit refactors the codebase to improve separation of concerns by moving the user-facing print function from the logging module to the interface module.

- **Relocated `print_ui_line`:**
  - The `print_ui_line` function, responsible for printing formatted status messages to the user, has been moved from `src/lib/loggers.sh` to `src/core/interfaces.sh`.
  - This change clarifies the distinction between internal application logging (`loggers.sh`) and user interface presentation (`interfaces.sh`).

- **Updated Function Calls:**
  - All calls to the old `loggers::print_ui_line` across the application (in `updates.sh`, `packages.sh`, `networks.sh`, and `validators.sh`) have been updated to `interfaces::print_ui_line`.

- **Removed Unused Error Helper:**
  - The redundant `errors::handle_error_and_exit` function was removed from `src/lib/errors.sh`, as its functionality is already covered by `errors::handle_error`.
