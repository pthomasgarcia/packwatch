refactor(error-handling): Implement centralized error hooks

This commit introduces a more robust and centralized error handling mechanism by implementing a system of error hooks.

- **New Error Hook System:**
  - The `updates.sh` module now includes a system for triggering error hooks. This allows for centralized error reporting and handling from various parts of the application.
  - The `errors::handle_error` and `errors::handle_error_and_exit` functions have been updated to accept an optional `custom_error_type` to provide more specific error information.

- **Improved Error Reporting in Modules:**
  - The `repositories.sh` and `updates.sh` modules have been updated to trigger the new error hooks on failure. This provides more detailed context about where and why an error occurred.

- **Enhanced Configuration Validation:**
  - The `configs::validate_single_config_file` function in `src/core/configs.sh` has been significantly improved to provide more specific validation for each application type.

- **Improved Version Normalization:**
  - The `versions::normalize` function has been enhanced to handle pre-release indicators (e.g., `-beta`, `-rc`) and to remove build metadata, making version comparisons more reliable.
  - The `versions::extract_from_json` and `versions::extract_from_regex` functions now validate the extracted version string against a semantic versioning format.
