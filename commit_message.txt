fix(scripts): Improve quoting and script logic

This commit includes several minor fixes and cleanups to improve the robustness and clarity of the scripts.

- **`script.sh`:**
  - The JSON payload for `updates::trigger_hooks` is now single-quoted to prevent issues with double quotes and special characters.
  - A redundant `chmod +x` call has been removed.
  - The `temp_script_path` variable is now explicitly assigned from `temp_download_file` for clarity.

- **`direct_download.sh`:**
  - The `filename` variable is now explicitly declared and assigned to avoid potential issues with variable scope.

- **`systems.sh`:**
  - The `cli_with_retry_or_error` function has been moved to a more logical location within the file.
  - Shellcheck disable comments have been added to `direct_download.sh` and `script.sh` to ignore unused variable warnings.
