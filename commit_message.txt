feat(installer): Add Ollama support via custom TGZ checker

This commit introduces a new custom checker for the Ollama application, which is installed from a TGZ archive. This required significant enhancements to the installer to support this new package type.

- **New Ollama Custom Checker:**
  - A new checker script (`ollama.sh`) has been added to fetch release information from the GitHub API, including the TGZ download URL and checksums.
  - The checker returns a JSON payload for the core update logic to process.

- **TGZ Installation Support:**
  - The `updates.sh` module now includes a generic `_install_tgz_command` to handle the download, checksum verification, extraction, and installation of binaries from `.tgz` files.
  - The custom checker flow has been updated to recognize and delegate to this new `tgz` installation type.

- **DEB Package Caching:**
  - The `.deb` file handling logic has been refactored to cache downloaded artifacts in `~/.cache/packwatch/artifacts/`.
  - This avoids re-downloading packages and removes the legacy file renaming logic.

- **UX Improvements:**
  - The installer now checks for an active `sudo` session before running installation commands, preventing unnecessary password prompts.
  - The `.gitignore` file has been updated to be more organized and to ignore `commit_message.txt`.
