feat(security): Enforce HTTPS and add robust GPG/checksum validation

This commit introduces major security enhancements by enforcing HTTPS by default and implementing a more secure and flexible GPG and checksum verification system.

- **HTTPS Enforcement:**
  - All network downloads now strictly require HTTPS unless explicitly overridden by a new `allow_insecure_http: true` flag in an application's configuration.
  - A new `networks::require_https_or_fail` function centralizes this enforcement.

- **Robust GPG Verification:**
  - Completely overhauled GPG verification in `gpg.sh` to use isolated, temporary keyrings for each check, preventing contamination of the user's main keyring.
  - Added `gpg::verify_detached` to handle detached signatures and strictly validate the key's fingerprint against the one in the config.
  - Keys can now be sourced automatically from URLs, keyservers, or WKD.

- **Expanded Checksum & Signature Support:**
  - The configuration `schema.json` has been updated to accept new optional fields: `checksum_url`, `sig_url`, `gpg_key_id`, and `gpg_fingerprint`.
  - Added a `validators::extract_checksum_from_file` helper to parse checksums from downloaded files (e.g., `sha256sum.txt`).

- **Configuration Validation:**
  - Updated `configs.sh` to correctly handle these new optional security fields during validation, ensuring they don't cause errors if absent.
