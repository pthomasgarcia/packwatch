refactor(updates): Centralize installation flow and config retrieval

This commit introduces a significant refactoring to centralize common logic, reduce code duplication, and improve the overall structure of the application.

- **Centralized Installation Flow:**
  - A new generic function, `updates::process_installation`, has been created in `src/core/updates.sh`. This function encapsulates the common logic for handling user prompts, dry runs, and updating the installed version JSON file.
  - The specific installation handlers for `deb`, `appimage`, `script`, and `flatpak` have been refactored to use this new centralized function, which dramatically reduces code duplication and makes the installation process more consistent.

- **Centralized Config Retrieval:**
  - A new function, `configs::get_app_config`, has been added to `src/core/configs.sh` to provide a single, consistent way to retrieve an application's configuration from the global state.
  - The `updates::check_application` function has been updated to use this new helper, simplifying its logic.
