refactor(configs): Centralize config retrieval and remove unused variables

This commit introduces several improvements to the configuration handling logic, making it more robust and efficient.

- **Centralized Application Config Retrieval:**
  - A new function, `configs::get_app_config`, has been created in `src/core/configs.sh` to act as the single source of truth for fetching an application's configuration.
  - The `updates::check_application` function has been refactored to use this new centralized function, removing duplicated logic.

- **Removed Unused Variables:**
  - The unused variable `apps_specified_on_cmdline` has been removed from `src/core/cli.sh`.
  - The unused variable `apps_to_check_json` has been removed from `src/core/configs.sh`.

These changes improve the modularity, maintainability, and efficiency of the codebase.
