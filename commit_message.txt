fix(core): Improve robustness and error handling

This commit introduces several fixes to improve the robustness and error handling of the scripts.

- **`hash_utils.sh`:**
  - The `generate_hash` function now validates that the input string is not empty, preventing errors from being thrown by the hashing commands.

- **`bootloader.sh`:**
  - The script now checks if `hash_utils.sh` exists before sourcing it, making the bootloader more resilient to missing files.

- **`zed.sh`:**
  - The script now handles cases where a value retrieved from the cache is "null" by setting it to an empty string. This prevents potential issues with downstream logic that expects an empty string instead of "null".
