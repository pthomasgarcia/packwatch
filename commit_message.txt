refactor(ui): Centralize ANSI color and formatting constants

This commit refactors the shell scripts to centralize ANSI color and text formatting definitions, improving code consistency and maintainability.

- **Centralized ANSI Constants:**
  - All ANSI escape codes for colors and text formatting (e.g., bold) have been consolidated into `readonly` global variables in `src/core/globals.sh`.

- **Removed Redundant Helpers:**
  - The local `_color_*` and `_bold` helper functions have been removed from `interfaces.sh` and `loggers.sh`, eliminating code duplication.

- **Standardized UI Output:**
  - All UI-related functions in `interfaces.sh`, `updates.sh`, `packages.sh`, and `validators.sh` have been updated to use the new global constants, ensuring a consistent look and feel.

- **Simplified `print_ui_line`:**
  - The `loggers::print_ui_line` function has been simplified to accept a color constant directly, making it more straightforward to use.
