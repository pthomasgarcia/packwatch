refactor(core): Improve sudo handling and user-context file management

This commit introduces a major refactoring to improve how the script handles file storage and executes commands requiring elevated privileges.

- **User-Specific Cache & Temp Directories:**
  - All temporary files and cached data are now stored in a user-specific directory (`~/.cache/packwatch/`) instead of the global `/tmp`.
  - This change prevents permission errors when running with `sudo` and ensures that user data is stored in the correct user's home directory.
  - A cleanup routine has been added to remove the legacy `/tmp/packwatch_cache` directory.

- **Explicit `sudo` Usage:**
  - Commands requiring root privileges (e.g., `apt install`, `flatpak`, `chown`) now explicitly use `sudo`. This removes the need to run the entire script as root.
  - The notification logic has been hardened to correctly send desktop notifications as the original user, even when the script is executed via `sudo`.

- **Non-Interactive File Operations:**
  - The `mv` and `cp` commands now use the `-f` flag to force overwrites, preventing the script from hanging on interactive prompts.
  - Added `commit_message.txt` and `CODE_REVIEW.md` to `.gitignore`.
