refactor(core): Abstract download-and-check logic into a utility module

This commit introduces a new utility module to abstract the common "download, verify, and extract version" workflow. It also includes numerous fixes to address ShellCheck warnings and improve robustness.

- **New Updater Utility Module:**
  - Created a new `src/util/updater_utils.sh` module to house shared helper functions for the update process.
  - A new `updater_utils::check_and_get_version_from_download` function now encapsulates the logic for "direct download" style checks, reducing code duplication.
  - The `check_direct_deb` handler has been refactored to use this new, simpler utility.

- **Code Hardening & ShellCheck Fixes:**
  - Addressed a wide range of ShellCheck warnings across the codebase, improving script reliability and correctness.
  - The user confirmation prompt now defaults to "yes" in non-interactive shells, preventing hangs in CI environments.
  - CLI flags (`--verbose`, `--dry-run`) are now correctly exported to ensure they are available in subshells.

- **`.gitignore`:**
  - Added `CHANGELOG.md` to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being accidentally committed.
