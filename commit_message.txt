feat(core): Add post-verification hooks and improve GitHub release parsing

This commit introduces a new hook system for verification results and significantly improves the robustness of parsing data from GitHub releases.

- **Post-Verification Hooks:**
  - Added a new `post_verify` hook that is triggered after every checksum and GPG signature check.
  - This hook provides detailed, structured JSON feedback on the verification outcome, including the algorithm, expected/actual values, and success status.

- **Robust GitHub Release Parsing:**
  - The `extract_checksum_from_release_body` function in `repositories.sh` is now much more flexible. It can search for multiple filename variations (e.g., with/without path prefixes) and supports user-defined alternations in the `checksum_pattern`.
  - The `find_asset_url` function was optimized to use a single, more efficient `jq` command to locate release assets.

- **Code Cleanup & Fixes:**
  - Removed the now-redundant `verify_checksum` and `verify_gpg_key` functions from `validators.sh`, as this logic is fully centralized.
  - Moved the GPG success message from `gpg.sh` to `updates.sh` to keep the library clean.
  - Fixed a `printf` format string bug in `updates.sh`.
