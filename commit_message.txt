feat(config): Implement robust validation with JSON Schema

This commit replaces the manual, brittle shell-based configuration validation with a robust system based on the industry-standard JSON Schema.

- **JSON Schema Integration:**
  - A formal `schema.json` has been introduced, defining the precise structure, types, and required fields for all application configurations.
  - The validation logic in `configs.sh` has been completely replaced with a call to `ajv-cli`, which validates config files against this new schema.
  - This provides far more reliable and maintainable validation with clearer error messages.

- **Dependency & Configuration Updates:**
  - `ajv` is now a required dependency for the script to run.
  - The `allow_insecure_http` flag has been updated to a proper boolean (`true`/`false`) in the schema and config files.

- **Code Quality:**
  - Addressed numerous new ShellCheck warnings across the codebase, particularly regarding unused variables and namerefs.
  - Added `CHANGELOG.md` to `.gitignore`.
