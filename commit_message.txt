refactor(checkers): Extract common logic into checker_utils

This commit introduces a new `checker_utils.sh` library to reduce code duplication and improve consistency across the custom checker scripts.

- **New `checker_utils.sh` library:**
  - Created a new file `src/lib/checker_utils.sh` to house common functions used by custom checkers.
  - Added `checker_utils::determine_status` to standardize the logic for checking if an update is needed.
  - Added `checker_utils::strip_version_prefix` to provide a consistent way to remove "v" prefixes from version strings.

- **Updated Custom Checkers:**
  - Refactored the custom checkers for Cursor, VeraCrypt, Warp, and Zed to use the new utility functions from `checker_utils.sh`.
  - This simplifies the code in each checker and ensures that the logic for determining update status and normalizing version strings is consistent.

- **Updated Main Script:**
  - The main script (`src/core/main.sh`) has been updated to source the new `checker_utils.sh` library.
