refactor(core): Harden module loading and simplify verification calls

This commit hardens the script's module loading, simplifies the verification workflow by removing a redundant abstraction layer, and expands the test suite.

- **Hardened Module Loading:**
  - The `gpg.sh` library is now loaded unconditionally during the scaffolding phase. This ensures GPG functions are always available and removes complex, brittle lazy-loading logic from the `verifiers` and `extensions` modules.

- **Simplified Verification API:**
  - The `updates::verify_downloaded_artifact` wrapper function has been removed. All modules now call `verifiers::verify_artifact` directly, simplifying the code and removing an unnecessary layer of abstraction.

- **Expanded Testing:**
  - The test suite for `verifiers.sh` has been expanded to cover network failure scenarios for checksum and signature downloads, improving test coverage for the core security logic.
  - A new `CHANGELOG.md` has been added to the project.
