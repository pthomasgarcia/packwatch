feat(checksum): Add support for GitHub release asset digests

This commit introduces a more reliable method for checksum verification by utilizing the `digest` field provided by the GitHub Releases API for assets.

- **New `checksum_from_github_release_digest` flag:**
  - A new boolean flag, `checksum_from_github_release_digest`, has been added to the configuration schema.
  - When set to `true`, the application will fetch the `sha256` digest directly from the release asset's metadata, ignoring other checksum-related fields.

- **Repository Logic:**
  - A new `repositories::find_asset_digest` function has been created to extract this digest.
  - The old, complex logic for finding checksums in release bodies or separate files (`extract_checksum_from_release_body`, `find_asset_checksum`) has been removed, simplifying the codebase.

- **Configuration Updates:**
  - The `fastfetch` and `ollama` configurations have been updated to use this new, simpler digest-based verification.
