refactor(core): Centralize artifact verification and streamline update handlers

This commit introduces a major architectural improvement by centralizing all post-download security checks into a single function and refactoring the update handlers to be more robust and maintainable.

- **Centralized Verification Function:**
  - Created a new `updates::verify_downloaded_artifact` function that handles all checksum and GPG signature validation for any downloaded file.
  - This function is now called by all update workflows (`deb`, `appimage`, `script`) immediately after download, ensuring consistent and secure verification.

- **Streamlined Update Handlers:**
  - Refactored all `process_*` and `check_*` functions in `updates.sh` to accept the application's configuration via a nameref (`local -n`).
  - This simplifies the function signatures and allows them to directly access all necessary configuration, including new security flags like `allow_insecure_http` and `checksum_url`.

- **Improved Workflow:**
  - The verification logic is now cleanly separated from the download and installation steps, improving code clarity and enforcing a secure "download, then verify, then install" workflow.
  - Custom checkers can now also use the new centralized verification function, promoting code reuse and security.
