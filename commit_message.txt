refactor(shell): Improve script style and correctness

This commit addresses several style and correctness issues identified by `shellcheck`, and improves the overall quality of the codebase.

- **Fix `shellcheck` warnings:**
  - **SC2181:** Replaced indirect exit code checks (`if [[ $? -ne 0 ]]`) with direct checks (`if ! command`) across multiple files for improved readability and robustness.
  - **SC2207:** Replaced unsafe array creation from command output with the more reliable `mapfile` command in `src/core/networks.sh`.
  - **SC2059:** Corrected the unsafe use of a variable as the `printf` format string in `src/core/custom_checkers/veracrypt.sh`.
  - **SC2001:** Replaced a `sed` command with a more efficient shell parameter expansion in `src/lib/systems.sh`.
  - **SC2153 & SC2034:** Added `shellcheck` directives to `src/core/globals.sh` and `src/core/interfaces.sh` to suppress false positive warnings about unused variables that are intentionally global.

- **Code Cleanup:**
  - Removed the unused `main-backup.sh` file.
  - Removed unused variables in `src/core/cli.sh` and `src/core/configs.sh`.
  - Improved code formatting and consistency in several files.
